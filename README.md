# placeholderGameAssets
A bunch of free assets fer game projects
## blend_files
Blender save files from my past 3d game projects.  Most of them are UV mapped.  Some provided textures, most can have their UV maps generated from the file or exported to make custom ones.  I tried to use folders to make them easier to browse through.
## 2D Assets
Contains icons, background, tiles, and sprites from my own side projects.  Just about all of it is either custom build or made with the default textures that come with GIMP.  A few of them I provided the original project files.  The sprites are uniform sprite sheets.

## Usage
I made this repo to help people that are just getting started in game dev have some graphics to use as placeholders while working on their project.  I have no dillusions that these sprites are in any way shape or form ready for professional use.  If you end up using any of these assets in a project that gets released, just let me know.  No payment expected.
